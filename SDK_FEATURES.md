## 🔧 How to Use

### Basic Workflow (Now Even Easier)

```bash
# 1. Research and brainstorm chapter 1
/prepareChapter 1
# → research-assistant creates comprehensive brainstorm
# → Hook auto-updates status to "🧠 Brainstormed"

# 2. Write the chapter
/writeChapter 1
# → chapter-writer transforms brainstorm into polished content
# → Hook auto-tracks word count and updates status to "✍️ Drafted"

# 3. Style review
/styleCheck 1
# → style-editor provides professional editorial feedback
# → You review and make suggested edits

# 4. Repeat for all chapters
/prepareChapter 2
/writeChapter 2
/styleCheck 2
# ...and so on
```

### Advanced Usage

**Explicit Subagent Invocation:**
```
"Use the research-assistant subagent to fact-check the claims in chapter 3"
"Use the chapter-writer to expand section 2 of chapter 5"
"Use the style-editor to compare the voice in chapters 1-3"
```

**Subagent + Main Claude Collaboration:**
```
"I need help with chapter 4. Use the research-assistant to find examples about [topic], then we'll discuss the best approach together before writing."
```

**Direct Subagent Access:**
The main Claude can still do everything the subagents can—subagents are specialists, not replacements. Use them when you want:
- Focused expertise
- Separate context for large tasks
- Automated workflows

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Trust the Specialists
The subagents are trained experts. Let them work autonomously:
- ✅ "Use the chapter-writer to write chapter 5"
- ❌ Don't micromanage: "Write chapter 5 but make sure to..."

### 2. Review Subagent Output
Subagents are experts, but you're the author:
- Review brainstorms before writing
- Review drafts before finalizing
- Make editorial decisions on style-editor suggestions

### 3. Use Hooks for Automation
Let hooks handle repetitive work:
- ✅ Word counting, status tracking (automated)
- ✅ Git commits, backups (can be automated)
- ❌ Creative decisions (keep human)

### 4. Combine Strengths
Main Claude + Subagents work together:
- Use subagents for specialized tasks
- Use main Claude for coordination and decisions
- Use main Claude when you want conversation/collaboration

### 5. Iterate and Improve
Subagents can be refined:
- Update system prompts based on output quality
- Adjust tool access as needed
- Add new subagents for emerging needs
