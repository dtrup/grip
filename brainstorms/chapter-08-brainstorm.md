# Chapter 8 Brainstorm: Schemas, Frames, and Scripts

**Word Target:** ~4,750 | **Tone:** Rigorous, concrete, forward-linking to Ch9

---

## Core Thesis
Repeated problem types crystallize into reusable templates—schemas, frames, scripts—that compress complex sequences into fast interpretation and action, trading flexibility for speed under time and working-memory budgets.

---

## Opening Hooks (pick 1–2)

1. **Restaurant Script:** You walk in. Order. Eat. Pay. Leave. No conscious deliberation. Why? Because this sequence is so routine that it chunks into a single interpretive frame. The schema fills in slots automatically: where to sit, when to speak, what "paying" means. This is grip via compression.

2. **Medical Diagnosis Under Pressure:** Radiologist scans 40 X-rays per day. Can't afford to examine every pixel. Instead, she activates a diagnostic prototype: "pneumonia looks like *this* opacity pattern, *this* location, *this* clinical history." Atypical cases—the patient with unusual anatomy or comorbidity—often get missed. Schema saves time; schema costs accuracy on boundary cases.

3. **Social Scripts:** Gender roles, job interviews, first dates—all are pre-packaged behavioral sequences. You know roughly what to expect and what's expected of you. This frees cognitive load for what's novel. But when the script no longer fits (your interviewer is silent, your date is nothing like your hopes), you must re-frame or flounder.

## Definition & Function

**Schema** (Bartlett 1932; Rumelhart & Ortony 1977): A mental template that organizes knowledge about recurring situations. Slots are filled by context variables.

**Frame** (Goffman 1974; Tannen on discourse): The interpretive lens through which a situation is understood; selects what's task-relevant and what's normative (what *should* happen).

**Script** (Schank & Abelson 1977): A linearized sequence of expected actions and outcomes for stereotyped events (restaurant, doctor visit, birthday party).

**Function under constraints:**
- **Time budget:** Schemas eliminate the need to re-solve routine problems. Activation is fast (~500ms for prototypical matches).
- **Working memory:** Chunking reduces load. Instead of tracking 20 independent details, you hold one slot-filling pattern.
- **Prediction:** Schemas function as priors. They predict what comes next, enabling attention capture when predictions are violated (prediction errors drive learning and arousal).

## Key Research Foundation

### Schema Learning & Development
- **Bartlett (1932)**: Schemas distort recall toward prototypes; memory is reconstructive, not reproductive.
- **Rumelhart & Ortony (1977)**: Schemas as hierarchical structures; variables and constraints.
- **Schank & Abelson (1977)**: Scripts are temporally ordered schemas; enable planning and inference.
- **Nelson (2005)**: Event schemas develop in infancy; infants as young as 6 months habituate to routine sequences, violate-expectation paradigm shows schema sensitivity.

### Prototype Theory & Typicality
- **Rosch (1973, 1978)**: Categories have graded membership; central exemplars (prototypes) are processed faster and are more error-prone when distorted.
- **Typicality effects:** Prototypical instances recalled better; atypical instances forgotten or distorted toward prototype (Posner & Keele 1968).
- **Graded structure:** "Robin" more typical bird than "penguin"; impacts speed, error rates, and neural activation.

### Neural Grounding
- **Binder et al. (2009)**: Default network (mPFC, angular gyrus, posterior cingulate) activates during semantic retrieval and schema instantiation.
- **Temporo-parietal junction (TPJ):** Central for mentalizing and social schema application (theory of mind).
- **Prefrontal cortex:** Slot-filling and variable binding under schema activation.

### Schema Violations & Prediction Error
- **Kutas & Hillyard (1984)**: N400 effect—semantic violation triggers larger negative ERP (300–500ms) proportional to expectancy violation magnitude.
- **Habituation & Mismatch Negativity (Ch6):** Repeated schema contexts trigger MMN when violated; automatic, attention-independent.

### Cultural & Linguistic Schemas
- **D'Andrade (1995)**: Cultural models as shared schemas; folk theories of mind, personhood, causality differ systematically across cultures.
- **Shore (1996)**: Constraints on cultural schemas; not infinitely variable—limited by cognition and interaction patterns.
- **Lakoff & Johnson (1980)**: Conceptual metaphors (e.g., "time is money") as schemas structuring reasoning across domains.

### Stereotype Rigidity & Frame-Lock
- **Fiske & Taylor (1991)**: Once activated, schemas bias information processing; confirmatory bias strengthens frame.
- **Bodenhausen (1988)**: Stereotypes activate automatically; disconfirming evidence is reinterpreted, suppressed, or attributed to exceptions ("He's not like *other* X's").
- **Kunda & Oleson (1995)**: Exceptional individuals are sub-typed, leaving stereotypes unchanged.

### Learning & Consolidation
- **McClelland, McNaughton, O'Reilly (1995)**: Connectionist models show how repeated exposure to patterns stabilizes weights; schemas emerge from learning without explicit encoding.
- **Sleep consolidation (Born & Wilhelm 2012):** Schema learning consolidated during sleep; REM/NREM replay strengthens prototypes.

## Best Examples (✅ Verified)

1. **Chess Masters & Board Positions** ✅
   - Experts recognize ~50,000 board configurations (de Groot, Chase & Simon 1973).
   - Pattern recognition, not raw computation. Chunks group pieces into familiar constellations.
   - RT to recall: ~1 sec for familiar positions; novice recall is nearly random.
   - Atypical positions (random arrangement) abolish expert advantage: schemas don't help when no pattern applies.

2. **Restaurant Script & Slot-Filling** ✅
   - Schank & Abelson (1977) canonical example: "John went to a restaurant. He ordered a hamburger. He left a tip. He left the restaurant."
   - Inference test: "Did he pay?" Most say yes (not stated, but inferred from script).
   - Shows automatic slot-filling: payment is *expected*, so it's *remembered* even if unstated.

3. **Radiological Diagnosis & Prototype Bias** ✅
   - Norman et al. (1992, 2009): Radiologists' error patterns reflect prototype activation.
   - Atypical pneumonia (fever without consolidation) missed 25% more often than classic pattern.
   - Implicit measure: reaction time to confirm typical vs. atypical cases; typical ~30% faster.

4. **Gender Schema in Children's Memory** ✅
   - Liben & Signorella (1980): Children shown gender-inconsistent toys (girl playing with truck) later misremember toy as gender-typical.
   - Schema distorts encoding and retrieval toward prototypes.
   - Measured via source-confusion errors: incorrect toy + gender-typical attribute.

5. **N400 to Schema Violation** ✅
   - Kutas & Hillyard (1984), Kuperberg et al. (2003): "He spread the warm butter on his *socks*" triggers larger N400 than "He spread the warm butter on his *bread*."
   - N400 amplitude correlates with semantic distance from expected word.
   - Shows automatic schema instantiation: neural system predicts context-appropriate continuations.

6. **Cultural Schemas & Folk Theories** ✅
   - D'Andrade (1987): American folk theory of mind treats thoughts as discrete, moveable entities ("I can't get that thought out of my head"). Ifaluk (Micronesia) treat thoughts as situational responses.
   - Different schema structures; different inferences follow (about responsibility, change, therapy).

## Compression/Expansion Moves

### Compression
- **Chunking:** Sequential steps → single unit (e.g., "paying" encompasses finding server, calling attention, exchanging money, leaving tip).
- **Slot-filling:** Generic slots filled by context (restaurant name, date, companions all vary, but schema structure stays invariant).
- **Frame selection:** Of all possible interpretations, choose the task-relevant one (in medical context, activate diagnostic frame, not social chat frame).
- **Prototype enforcement:** Replace atypical features with modal features during storage/retrieval.

### Expansion
- **Frame rotation:** Re-interpret situation under new schema (meeting is not threat assessment, but information exchange; activates collaborative rather than competitive frame).
- **Repertoire growth:** Learn new schemas when old ones fail (new restaurant type, novel disease presentation, unfamiliar social context).
- **Schema elaboration:** Add exception handlers and sub-schemas (sophisticated restaurant patron knows when standard script breaks; keeps flexible sub-routines).

---

## Failure Modes

1. **Frame-Lock:** Schema chosen early; evidence reinterpreted to fit frame.
   - Patient with atypical presentation; doctor locks into flu diagnosis; negative flu test reinterpreted as false negative.
   - Measured: time to frame switch, accuracy on disconfirming features.

2. **Prototype Bias:** Central exemplars prioritized; boundary cases distorted or forgotten.
   - Medical: textbook presentations recognized, messy comorbidities missed.
   - Social: stereotype persists despite individual variation.

3. **Over-Compression:** Too much is lost in chunking.
   - Restaurant script applied to fine-dining context fails; script predicts fast casual, reality is slow luxury.
   - Measured: error rate on atypical cases; frame-switch cost (time to correct).

4. **Cultural Schema Mismatch:** Schemas internalized in one culture applied to another.
   - Western medical schema (mind/body dualism) misapplies in cultures with integrated personhood models.
   - Result: miscommunication, treatment non-compliance.

## Measures & Tests

1. **Schema Learning Curves**
   - Reaction time to categorize exemplars: typical vs. atypical.
   - Error rates should show: typical → fast + accurate; atypical → slow + errors.
   - Plotted across repeated exposures: should show asymptotic learning.

2. **Frame-Switch Costs**
   - Prime with one frame (medical, social, competitive), then present ambiguous stimulus.
   - Latency to re-interpret under new frame; cost = RT(new frame) – RT(old frame).
   - Should be 100–300ms; larger for more entrenched frames.

3. **Stereotype Error Diagnostics**
   - Memory for attributes incongruent with stereotype: should be poorly remembered.
   - Measured via source confusion: high error on "Who was the female doctor?" after seeing female nurse photo.
   - ROC curves should show bias toward stereotype-consistent responses.

4. **N400 Amplitudes**
   - EEG while reading: phrase ending violates script prediction.
   - N400 amplitude predicts predictability of final word.
   - Manipulation: increase time pressure → earlier constraint satisfaction → larger N400 to violated predictions.

5. **Typicality ROC/Graded Membership**
   - Ask "Is X a [category]?" on 1–5 scale for prototypical and boundary exemplars.
   - ROC curves should show monotonic relationship: highest for prototypes, declining toward boundaries.
   - Fit Gaussian model to typicality gradient; use width as "schema rigidity" measure.

6. **Developmental Trajectory**
   - Infants (6–12 months): Habituation times to routine sequences; violation-of-expectation looking time.
   - Toddlers (2–3 years): Event description accuracy; omissions vs. distortions.
   - Children (4–8 years): False memories reflecting schema intrusion; errors skew toward prototypes.

## Cross-Chapter Links

**Chapter 5 (Rate-Distortion Life):** Schemas implement rate-distortion compression. Irrelevant variation discarded; task-relevant variation preserved. Asymmetric error costs explain which distortions emerge.

**Chapter 6 (Predictive Brains):** Schemas function as hierarchical priors. Prediction errors when schemas misfit reality; precision-weighted gain determines schema updating speed.

**Chapter 7 (Helpful Misrepresentations):** Schema-based stereotypes can improve speed at cost of accuracy on atypical cases. This is adaptive under time pressure; fails when constraints change or when rigidity (frame-lock) prevents updating.

**Chapter 9 (Symbols & Narratives):** Schemas externalized as stories, archetypes, cultural narratives. "The hero's journey" is a schema for storytelling; "the self-made entrepreneur" is a cultural schema shaping ambition and blame.
