# Chapter 5: Rate–Distortion Life

You're hiking alone when something moves in the periphery—dark, coiled, near your boot. Your body reacts before thought: heart spikes, weight shifts, hand reaches. A second later you see it's a curved twig, shadow-draped. Relief floods in.

But notice what just happened. You didn't run Bayesian inference on pixel arrays. You didn't catalog all possible twig-like and snake-like objects. You *compressed* ambiguous input into a fast, actionable category—"threat?"—tuned to consequences, not correspondence. That asymmetry is stark: falsely identifying a stick as a snake costs a moment of adrenaline; missing an actual snake costs your life.

Your visual system has solved a rate-distortion problem. It sacrificed veridical accuracy for speed and survival, allocating limited discrimination capacity to the boundaries that matter. This isn't a bug in perception. It's the solution evolution built when bandwidth is expensive and stakes are asymmetric.

This chapter formalizes that intuition. Limited information channels force *task-weighted lossy compression*—systems that discard details to preserve what matters for control. The trade-off is fundamental: perfect fidelity requires infinite rate; finite channels demand selective distortion. How we weight that distortion—what we compress, what we preserve—reveals what we're optimizing for.

We'll see this pattern across scales. Retinal ganglion cells compress 100 million photoreceptors into 1 million axons, discarding redundancy while preserving edges and motion. Infants tune phoneme discrimination to their native language, sharpening boundaries for contrasts they'll need, blurring those they won't. Russian speakers carve blue into *siniy* and *goluboy* where English speakers see one category, gaining discrimination speed at the cost of abstraction across the boundary.

Rate-distortion theory provides the formal spine. The information bottleneck generalizes it for prediction tasks. Categorical perception implements it in flesh. The result is a perceptual dashboard built for action under constraints, not a camera aimed at truth.

## The Rate-Distortion Function

Claude Shannon established the fundamental limits of lossy compression in 1959. The rate-distortion function *R(D)* specifies the minimum number of bits required to represent a signal while keeping reconstruction error below a threshold *D*. There's no free lunch: zero distortion requires infinite rate; finite channels demand acceptable loss.

The key insight is that "acceptable" depends on the task. Distortion isn't a physical property—it's a consequence measure weighted by payoffs. Audio compression discards frequencies above human hearing not because they don't exist, but because preserving them would waste rate on signals we can't use. MP3 achieves 10:1 compression by measuring error perceptually, not physically: loud tones mask nearby quiet ones, so the quiet can be discarded without audible degradation.

Formally, the rate-distortion problem is:

**R(D) = min I(X;X̂)** subject to **E[d(X, X̂)] ≤ D**

We minimize mutual information *I(X;X̂)* between source *X* and reconstruction *X̂* while keeping expected distortion *E[d(X, X̂)]* below *D*. The distortion measure *d(·,·)* encodes task relevance—squared error for Gaussian signals, Hamming distance for discrete codes, perceptual metrics for human systems.

For a Gaussian source with variance σ², the rate-distortion function is:

**R(D) = ½ log(σ²/D)** for **D < σ²**

This says compression scales logarithmically: halving distortion costs one bit of rate. The curve traces an inevitable trade-off—more fidelity requires more bandwidth, and the price accelerates as you approach perfection.

But agents don't aim for perfection. They aim for control. The distortion measure *d(X,X̂)* should weight errors by their consequences for action, not their magnitude in physical space. A perceptual system is a rate-distortion optimizer with a loss function tuned to survival, reproduction, and goal achievement—what we'll formalize in Chapter 14 as the multi-objective Lagrangian with value-weighted distortions.

The implication is profound: perception is *intentionally* lossy. Evolution built us to discard irrelevant detail and amplify task-relevant structure. The question isn't whether we compress, but *how*—which features we preserve, which boundaries we sharpen, which distinctions we blur.

## The Information Bottleneck

Rate-distortion theory assumes you know what to preserve. But often the goal isn't reconstructing the source; it's predicting a target. Naftali Tishby, Fernando Pereira, and William Bialek introduced the information bottleneck (IB) in 1999 to handle this: find a compressed representation *T* of input *X* that maximizes information about target *Y* while minimizing rate.

The objective is:

**L = I(X;T) - βI(T;Y)**

We minimize *I(X;T)*—the information transmitted from input to representation—while maximizing *I(T;Y)*—the information the representation preserves about the target. The parameter β controls the trade-off: high β favors compression (discard more), low β favors fidelity (preserve more).

This reframes learning as optimal forgetting. You don't memorize every detail; you compress inputs to preserve structure relevant to prediction. Irrelevant variation—speaker pitch, lighting angle, font choice—gets discarded. Task-relevant invariants—phoneme category, object identity, sentence meaning—get amplified.

Tishby's insight was that categorical perception falls out naturally from IB optimization. If you want to predict linguistic meaning from acoustic waveforms, the optimal compressed representation carves continuous voice onset time (VOT) into discrete phoneme categories at the boundary that maximizes *I(T;Y)*. Discriminating within categories wastes rate on distinctions that don't improve prediction; discriminating across categories concentrates resolution where it matters.

The information bottleneck has been applied to deep neural networks, where it suggests networks undergo two phases during training: an initial "fitting" phase where *I(X;T)* increases, then a "compression" phase where *I(X;T)* decreases while *I(T;Y)* stabilizes. The network learns to forget—discarding input details that don't help predict the target. There's controversy about whether this compression occurs with all activation functions (ReLU vs. sigmoid), but the conceptual point stands: good representations compress aggressively while preserving task-relevant structure.

For perception, the biological interpretation is clear. Sensory systems face massive input dimensionality and limited downstream bandwidth. The retina sees ~10⁹ bits per second but transmits ~10⁶ bits per second through the optic nerve. Speech unfolds in continuous acoustic space but must map to discrete phonemes. Visual arrays contain astronomical combinatorics but must guide categorical decisions—friend or foe, safe or threat, edible or toxic.

The information bottleneck says: compress *X* (sensory input) to preserve information about *Y* (behaviorally relevant outcomes). The result is a perceptual interface tuned to consequences, not correspondence—a dashboard for control, not a camera for truth.

## Categorical Perception as Lossy Compression

Categorical perception is the psychophysical signature of task-weighted compression. Continuous stimuli are perceived as discrete categories; discrimination peaks at category boundaries and drops within categories. The perceptual space is warped—resolution concentrated where distinctions matter, collapsed where they don't.

The classic demonstration is phoneme perception. Synthetic speech stimuli vary voice onset time (VOT) continuously from 0 to 60 milliseconds. Physically, these are equidistant steps along an acoustic continuum. Perceptually, they fall into two sharp categories: VOTs below ~12ms are heard as /ba/, VOTs above as /pa/.

Ask listeners to identify each stimulus: you get a steep sigmoidal function with a boundary at ~12ms. Now test discrimination: present pairs of stimuli and ask if they sound different. Pairs straddling the boundary (e.g., 8ms vs. 16ms) are easily discriminated despite being only 8ms apart. Pairs within categories (e.g., 4ms vs. 12ms, or 20ms vs. 28ms) are hard to discriminate despite similar or greater physical separation.

This is the hallmark of categorical perception: identification functions are steep, discrimination peaks at boundaries. The perceptual system allocates its limited discrimination budget to the contrasts that predict different behavioral outcomes (different phonemes, different words, different meanings) and collapses variation within categories as irrelevant noise.

The effect generalizes across modalities. Color perception shows categorical boundaries at basic color terms—discriminating blue from green is faster than discriminating two blues, even when physical wavelength differences are equated. Facial expressions, musical intervals, and object categories all show the pattern: continuous input, discrete percepts, peaked discrimination at boundaries.

Cross-linguistic evidence reveals the role of task relevance. Russian obligatorily distinguishes *siniy* (dark blue) from *goluboy* (light blue) with separate words. English collapses both under "blue." When Russian and English speakers discriminate blue color chips, Russian speakers are 124ms faster for pairs crossing the *siniy*/*goluboy* boundary. English speakers show no advantage—for them, both are within-category.

Crucially, this effect disappears under verbal interference. When Russian speakers perform a concurrent verbal task (articulatory suppression), their discrimination advantage vanishes; spatial interference has no effect. This shows the categorical boundary is linguistically mediated, actively maintained by the system that weights distortion by communicative payoff.

Infants provide developmental evidence for compression tuning. At 6-8 months, they discriminate phoneme contrasts from any language—Hindi retroflex vs. dental stops, Salish glottalic consonants, Japanese /r/ vs. /l/. By 10-12 months, raised in an English environment, they lose discrimination for non-native contrasts while sharpening discrimination for English-relevant distinctions.

This is statistical learning in action. The infant's perceptual system encounters a distribution of sounds and learns which boundaries predict different outcomes (different responses from caregivers, different meanings) and which are noise (within-category variation). It allocates rate to preserve information about native phonemes and compresses away distinctions absent from the ambient language. The result is perceptual tuning—enhanced discrimination for task-relevant contrasts, degraded discrimination for irrelevant ones.

Janet Werker and Richard Tees demonstrated this with Hindi-speaking and English-speaking infants. The Hindi contrast (retroflex vs. dental /t/) is phonemic in Hindi but allophonic (non-contrastive) in English. Hindi-reared infants maintain discrimination; English-reared infants lose it by 10-12 months. The developmental trajectory is the same for other non-native contrasts: universal discrimination early, native-language tuning later.

This isn't maturation of a fixed perceptual system. It's adaptive compression under constraints—learning to forget distinctions that don't predict consequences, freeing resources for finer discrimination within task-relevant categories.

## Neural Implementation: Efficient Coding

The brain must implement these compression strategies in neural hardware, where spikes are expensive and channels are limited. The efficient coding hypothesis, introduced by Horace Barlow and Fred Attneave in the 1950s, proposes that sensory neurons minimize transmission costs (spike count) while maximizing transmitted information.

The retina provides the canonical example. The human retina contains roughly 100 million rods plus 6 million cones, but the optic nerve has only ~1 million ganglion cell axons. This forces a compression ratio of approximately 100:1 before information leaves the eye. Assuming photoreceptors collectively encode ~10⁹ bits per second and each ganglion cell transmits ~1,000 spikes per second carrying ~1 bit each, the optic nerve bandwidth is ~10⁶ bits per second. The retina must compress by a factor of 1,000.

How? Center-surround receptive fields implement spatial differentiation—encoding contrasts (edges) rather than absolute intensities. Since natural images are spatially correlated, this decorrelates the signal, removing redundancy and concentrating information in unexpected features. Temporal filtering does the same across time: ganglion cells spike more for changes (onsets, offsets, motion) than for static luminance.

The efficiency is measurable. Eero Doi and colleagues quantified the information transmitted by primate retinal ganglion cells about natural image patches and compared it to the theoretical Shannon limit for a channel with the same spike statistics. They found transmission efficiency of ~80%—close to the maximum possible given the noise and bandwidth constraints.

This confirms the efficient coding hypothesis: the retina operates near the rate-distortion frontier, maximizing information about task-relevant visual features (edges, motion, contrast) while discarding redundant variation (uniform regions, slow changes in mean luminance).

V1 simple cells in primary visual cortex extend this principle. Their receptive fields resemble Gabor filters—oriented edge detectors at various spatial frequencies and orientations. These turn out to be statistically optimal for natural image statistics: they form an efficient code (minimal redundancy, maximal information) when the input distribution matches natural scenes. The brain builds filters tuned to the world it evolved to navigate.

Auditory systems show the same logic. Cochlear frequency tuning matches the spectral statistics of natural sounds—more resolution in frequency bands rich in behaviorally relevant information (speech formants, animal calls), less in bands dominated by noise. The auditory nerve bandwidth is limited; efficient coding allocates it to preserve structure that predicts action-relevant outcomes.

The pattern is general: neural encoding strategies decorrelate inputs, amplify surprising signals, and allocate rate to preserve information about predictions that matter. Efficient coding is rate-distortion optimization in flesh—perceptual systems are lossy compressors, and the loss function is calibrated by evolutionary and developmental experience with payoff structures.

## Asymmetric Error Costs and Decision Criteria

Compression becomes even more consequential when errors have asymmetric costs. Missing a predator is fatal; flinching at a shadow is cheap. Overlooking cancer is catastrophic; ordering an unnecessary biopsy is uncomfortable. The optimal decision criterion depends not just on signal quality but on the relative harm of false negatives versus false positives.

Signal detection theory (SDT), developed by David Green and John Swets in the 1960s, formalizes this. It separates sensitivity (the ability to distinguish signal from noise) from criterion (the threshold for saying "signal present"). Sensitivity is quantified by *d'* (d-prime), the separation between signal and noise distributions. Criterion is quantified by *c* (or β), the decision threshold—liberal criteria (low threshold) yield high hit rates and high false alarms; conservative criteria (high threshold) yield low hit rates and low false alarms.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves visualize the trade-off. They plot true positive rate (sensitivity) against false positive rate (1 - specificity) as the criterion varies. Each point on the curve represents a different threshold choice. The area under the ROC curve measures overall sensitivity; the chosen operating point reflects the cost structure.

In medical screening, the stakes favor sensitivity—better to catch all cases (high true positives) even if it means many false alarms (healthy patients flagged for follow-up). Mammography uses a liberal criterion to minimize missed cancers. Confirmatory tests reverse the priority—better to avoid unnecessary surgery (high specificity) even if it means a slightly higher miss rate. The ROC framework makes the trade-off explicit: there is no "perfect" threshold, only different distributions of error weighted by consequences.

Snake detection illustrates how evolution sets these criteria. The Snake Detection Theory, developed by Lynne Isbell, argues that 60 million years of predation pressure from venomous snakes shaped primate vision. The neurophysiological evidence is striking: pulvinar neurons (subcortical visual processing) respond faster and more strongly to snake stimuli than to faces, hands, or neutral objects. Response latencies are 10-20ms shorter; firing rates are 2-3× higher.

Behaviorally, humans detect snakes faster in visual search tasks than birds, flowers, or non-threatening animals, even when images are degraded by low-pass filtering or partial occlusion. Event-related potential (ERP) studies show an enhanced P1 wave (120-150ms post-stimulus) for snake images compared to controls—early visual processing is tuned to snake-like features (coiled form, scale patterns, elongated body).

This is asymmetric criterion placement in action. The cost of a false negative (missing a snake) is death. The cost of a false positive (mistaking a stick for a snake) is a moment of adrenaline. Evolution built a perceptual system with a liberal threshold for threat detection—high sensitivity, tolerate false alarms. The result is pareidolia for snakes: ropes, hoses, curved branches, even hose connectors trigger the alarm. We'd rather flinch at a thousand sticks than miss one viper.

The failure mode is false positives—phobias, hypervigilance, costly over-reactions. But from an evolutionary perspective, the criterion is correctly calibrated. The expected cost of false negatives vastly exceeds the expected cost of false positives when the signal (actual snake) is rare but lethal.

Signal detection theory provides a formal language for these trade-offs. The optimal Bayesian criterion is:

**β* = [P(noise)/P(signal)] × [C(miss)/C(false alarm)]**

It weighs the base rates of signal versus noise and the costs of the two error types. If *C(miss)* >> *C(false alarm)*—missing the signal is much worse than a false alarm—then the optimal threshold is low (liberal criterion). If base rates are low—snakes are rare—the threshold should be even lower to catch the few cases despite high false alarm rates.

Perceptual systems implement this logic, not through explicit Bayesian calculation, but through evolutionary tuning of neural thresholds and learned adjustments based on experience. The point is that *distortion* in rate-distortion theory isn't just reconstruction error; it's consequence-weighted error. What looks like a perceptual "bias" from a correspondence standpoint is a rational compression strategy from a control standpoint.

## Task-Dependent Attention Allocation

If perception is compression, then attention is the mechanism that allocates rate dynamically. Not all features matter equally at all times; the task determines where to spend limited discrimination capacity. Attention gates what enters the information bottleneck—it weights the distortion measure on the fly.

Value-driven attentional capture (VDAC) demonstrates this. Brian Anderson and colleagues showed that visual features previously paired with reward automatically capture attention, even when task-irrelevant. In their experiments, participants search for a shape singleton (e.g., a circle among diamonds) to earn points. During training, one color (say, red) predicts high reward. In the test phase, participants search for shape; color is irrelevant. Yet when a red distractor appears, search slows by 50-100ms—the previously rewarded feature captures attention involuntarily.

This effect persists for months after training. It's not purely stimulus-driven (salience) or purely goal-driven (top-down control)—it's value-driven. The attentional priority map has been reshaped by learned payoffs. High-value features consume more of the rate budget; they receive finer discrimination even when currently irrelevant.

Jeremy Wolfe synthesized this into a model of visual search guided by five factors: bottom-up salience, top-down goals, scene structure, selection history, and relative value. The key insight is that attention isn't a single process—it's a composite of stimulus-driven, goal-driven, and value-driven mechanisms, all competing for limited processing capacity.

This connects directly to rate-distortion. Attention determines which signals receive high-resolution encoding (low distortion, high rate cost) and which receive coarse encoding (high distortion, low rate cost). A driver watching for pedestrians allocates rate to motion in peripheral vision; a radiologist examining a mammogram allocates rate to texture gradients in specific regions. The distortion measure is task-dependent and dynamically weighted.

The neural substrate involves dopamine modulation of sensory gain. Prediction errors (unexpected rewards, violated expectations) trigger dopamine release, which amplifies cortical responses to associated stimuli. Over time, stimuli that predict valuable outcomes receive enhanced processing—higher firing rates, sharper tuning curves, faster response latencies. The system learns which features deserve rate investment.

This resolves an apparent paradox: if perception is compressed, how do we notice unexpected details? The answer is that compression is conditional on expectations. Predictable features are compressed aggressively (low rate); surprising features trigger exploration and receive high-rate encoding (we'll formalize this as epistemic value in Chapter 11). Attention is the switch: it expands the rate budget for signals that violate predictions or promise high value, and compresses signals that match expectations or offer low payoff.

## Measures and Tests

Rate-distortion theory makes precise, testable predictions about perception. If perceptual systems optimize lossy compression under asymmetric costs, we should see:

**1. Categorical boundaries emerge where task relevance shifts.**

Test: Measure identification and discrimination functions across a stimulus continuum. Predict steep identification slopes and peaked discrimination at boundaries that differentiate behaviorally relevant outcomes.

Example: Phoneme perception (/ba/ vs. /pa/), color terms (Russian *siniy* vs. *goluboy*), facial expressions (happy vs. neutral). Manipulation: Train new categories (associate arbitrary features with differential rewards) and measure boundary formation.

Metric: Psychometric slope (steepness of identification curve) and discrimination peak (within- vs. across-category accuracy).

**2. Decision criteria shift with manipulated costs.**

Test: Use signal detection tasks where payoffs vary across blocks (high reward for hits vs. high penalty for false alarms). Predict criterion shifts (liberal vs. conservative) while *d'* (sensitivity) remains constant.

Example: Threat detection (vary whether misses or false alarms are costly), medical diagnosis (screening vs. confirmation context). Measure hit rate, false alarm rate, and ROC curves.

Metric: Criterion *c* and bias parameter β; plot ROC curves to verify sensitivity (*d'*) is stable while operating point shifts.

**3. Compression ratios near theoretical limits.**

Test: Measure mutual information *I(input; output)* in neural systems and compare to Shannon capacity given bandwidth constraints.

Example: Retinal ganglion cells (Doi et al., 2012), cochlear nerve fibers, cortical receptive fields. Predict efficiency near 80% of channel capacity for natural stimuli.

Metric: Information transmission (bits/spike), decorrelation (redundancy reduction), efficiency relative to Shannon bound.

**4. Learned value reshapes attentional priority.**

Test: Train associations between features and rewards, then test attentional capture when features are task-irrelevant. Predict distraction costs proportional to learned value.

Example: VDAC paradigm (Anderson et al., 2011), visual search with reward history. Measure reaction time costs for high-value distractors.

Metric: RT difference (distractor present vs. absent), persistence over time (test months post-training), modulation by current task demands.

**5. Information bottleneck curves fit empirical data.**

Test: For categorization tasks, vary compression parameter β and measure *I(X;T)* vs. *I(T;Y)*. Predict humans operate near the optimal IB frontier.

Example: Phoneme learning (Tishby's original application), object categorization, perceptual learning tasks. Compare human performance to IB-optimal solutions.

Metric: Mutual information *I(input; representation)* and *I(representation; target)*, position on IB curve (compression-prediction trade-off).

Each of these tests operationalizes rate-distortion predictions and quantifies perceptual compression strategies. They bridge formal theory to measurable phenomena, making the framework falsifiable and empirically grounded. This is how we move from "perception might be lossy" to "perception is demonstrably rate-distortion optimization with these specific parameters."

## Failures and Limits

Rate-distortion framing reveals not just how perception succeeds, but how it fails. Compression strategies that work under stable task demands become liabilities when the world shifts.

**Over-compression: categorical rigidity.** When boundaries are too sharp, novel exemplars get forced into familiar categories. This is useful when most snakes resemble past snakes, but fails when a new morphology appears (mimics, novel camouflage). The system discards within-category variation that might have been diagnostic. The fix is degeneracy—maintaining redundant representations so a single compression failure doesn't collapse all discrimination. We'll formalize this in Chapter 12.

**Under-compression: paralysis by detail.** The opposite failure: allocating rate uniformly, failing to prioritize task-relevant structure. This is computationally expensive and slow. In environments with tight time budgets (predator approach, market crash, medical emergency), delayed decisions kill. The failure mode here is insufficient compression—trying to preserve too much, discriminating where it doesn't matter.

**Frame-lock: distortion measures become fixed.** The most insidious failure is when the loss function itself becomes entrenched. If perceptual categories are learned from past payoffs, they reflect past environments. When payoffs shift—predators evolve, diets change, technologies emerge—old categories become maladaptive. The system continues compressing with outdated priors, discarding now-relevant information and preserving now-irrelevant structure.

Goodhart's law applies to perception: when a distortion measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good distortion measure. Perceptual habits crystallize into perceptual traps. The solution is meta-learning—updating the loss function itself when prediction errors accumulate. Chapter 6 will show how predictive processing implements this through hierarchical precision weighting; the Coda will formalize how to revise the framework when the framework itself fails.

**When distortion helps.** Not all distortion is failure. Some misrepresentations are *helpful*—they improve control even while sacrificing correspondence. Overconfidence accelerates decisions; categorical boundaries enable coordination through shared symbols; optimistic priors sustain motivation. Chapter 7 catalogs these cases: systematic distortions that increase fitness despite decreasing fidelity.

The rate-distortion perspective makes this coherent. Distortion is weighted by consequences, not truth. If a compressed representation yields better control—faster action, lower coordination costs, sustained engagement—then it's optimal to compress that way, even if reconstruction error is high. Perception is a dashboard for action, and dashboards are designed to be read quickly, not to be accurate maps.

## Control Over Correspondence

The thread running through this chapter is that perception is not about reconstructing the world; it's about controlling the world under constraints. Rate-distortion theory formalizes this: the distortion measure encodes payoffs, not pixel accuracy. Systems that compress to maximize control outcompete systems that compress to maximize fidelity.

Categorical perception isn't a failure to see continuous variation; it's an adaptive allocation of limited discrimination to boundaries that predict different actions. Asymmetric decision criteria aren't biases; they're optimal thresholds given asymmetric costs. Snake pareidolia isn't paranoia; it's the evolutionarily rational response to rare but lethal signals. Value-driven attention isn't distraction; it's learned prioritization of high-payoff features.

This reframes long-standing debates in philosophy of perception. Indirect realists worry that we see representations, not reality. Pragmatists reply that correspondence is secondary to coordination. Rate-distortion theory cuts through: we see *compressed* representations optimized for control. Whether that counts as "seeing reality" depends on your definition of reality—physics (no), affordances (yes), shared interfaces (we'll explore this in Chapters 8-10).

The formal spine is this: agents face a multi-objective optimization—maximize control (utility *U*), minimize information cost (rate *R*), subject to constraints (time, energy, risk). Perception solves a Lagrangian:

**L = U(π) - λ_R · I(X;T) - Σ λ_i · C_i(π)**

Where *π* is a policy (perception-action mapping), *I(X;T)* is transmitted information (rate cost of the representation *T*), and *C_i* are other constraints (time, energy, error costs). The Lagrange multipliers *λ* are scarcity prices—how much control you're willing to sacrifice for one bit of compression, one joule of energy, one millisecond of time.

Chapter 14 will make this fully formal. For now, the takeaway is that distortion isn't a bug; it's a design parameter. Perceptual systems compress, and they compress *strategically*—discarding what doesn't predict control outcomes, amplifying what does, and setting decision thresholds to minimize consequence-weighted error.

## Forward to Prediction

This chapter treated perception as a static compression problem: map high-dimensional input to low-dimensional representation while preserving task-relevant structure. But organisms aren't passive sensors; they're active predictors. Time adds a new dimension: you can compress not just by selecting features, but by predicting the future and encoding only deviations from expectations.

Predictive processing, the subject of Chapter 6, extends rate-distortion into the temporal domain. The brain is a prediction machine; perception is the process of reconciling predictions with sensory evidence. Prediction errors are compressed (only unexpected signals get transmitted); expected signals are suppressed (redundant with prior predictions). This is rate-distortion with a temporal twist: allocate rate to surprise, compress away predictability.

Attention becomes precision weighting: how much to trust predictions versus observations. When predictions are reliable, sensory inputs are heavily compressed (low precision, high compression). When predictions fail, sensory inputs receive high-fidelity encoding (high precision, low compression). This dynamic rate allocation extends the static information bottleneck into a closed loop—perception updates predictions, predictions modulate perception.

The payoff-biased perceptual categories we carved in this chapter become the priors that shape predictions in the next. Categorical boundaries determine what counts as "expected" versus "surprising"; learned payoffs determine how much rate to invest in different prediction errors. The snake gets high-precision processing because evolution weighted that prediction error heavily; the stick gets low precision because the error cost is negligible.

We've established that perception is a lossy compressor tuned to consequences. Chapter 6 will show that it's also a generative model, predicting sensory inputs and compressing by encoding only what the model failed to predict. Chapter 7 will then ask: if distortion is strategic, when is it optimal to misrepresent systematically?

Rate-distortion gives us the formal language. Categorical perception gives us the empirical phenomena. Predictive processing gives us the mechanism. Together they reveal perception as neither camera nor illusion, but a dashboard under construction—compressed, biased, task-weighted, and relentlessly oriented toward control.

## Chapter Summary (for continuity tracking)

**Core Argument**: Perceptual systems implement rate-distortion optimization, compressing high-dimensional inputs into task-weighted representations that preserve information relevant to control, not correspondence. Categorical boundaries, asymmetric decision criteria, and value-driven attention are not bugs but adaptive compression strategies calibrated by payoffs. The distortion measure encodes what matters for behavior; agents discard distinctions irrelevant to outcomes and sharpen those that predict different actions.

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- **Rate-distortion function**: Minimum information rate needed for tolerable reconstruction error; fundamental trade-off with no free lunch.
- **Information bottleneck**: Compress input X to preserve information about task-relevant output Y while minimizing rate; formalizes perception as lossy encoding for prediction.
- **Categorical perception**: Continuous stimuli discretized into sharp perceptual categories; discrimination peaks at boundaries that predict different actions.
- **Efficient coding**: Sensory neurons decorrelate inputs and amplify surprising features; compression ratio near 100:1 in retina (100M photoreceptors → 1M ganglion cells).
- **Asymmetric error costs**: Decision criteria shift with payoff structure; false negatives cost differently than false alarms; evolution sets thresholds via asymmetric costs.
- **Snake detection theory**: 60 million years of predation pressure from venomous snakes shaped primate vision; threat biases are evolutionarily rational when miss costs >> false alarm costs.

**Major Examples Used**:
- Phoneme perception: continuous voice onset time (VOT) compressed into /ba/ vs. /pa/ categories; Russian speakers show enhanced discrimination for *siniy*/*goluboy* boundary (linguistically marked), English speakers don't.
- Retinal compression: center-surround receptive fields encode edges and motion, discard uniform regions; ~80% efficient relative to Shannon capacity.
- Infants' phoneme tuning: universal discrimination at 6-8 months, Native-language tuning by 10-12 months; perceptual categories learned from statistical structure of ambient language.
- Snake pareidolia: ropes, hoses, curved branches trigger threat response; false positives cost only adrenaline, false negatives cost death—optimal criterion is liberal.
- MP3 compression: discard frequencies above human hearing and leverage loudness-masking; 10:1 compression via perceptually meaningful loss.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Chapter 6 extends rate-distortion temporally. If spatial compression discards irrelevant features, temporal compression discards predictable redundancy. Prediction errors—not predictions themselves—consume bandwidth. Attention becomes precision-weighted gain control: allocate processing to surprising, high-reliability signals; suppress confirmed expectations as low-priority noise.

**Chapter 5 establishes:** Perceptual systems implement rate-distortion optimization, compressing high-dimensional inputs into task-weighted representations that preserve information relevant to control. Categorical boundaries, asymmetric decision criteria, and value-driven attention are not perceptual failures but adaptive compression strategies under bandwidth constraints and asymmetric payoffs. The formal spine is the information bottleneck; the empirical signature is categorical perception; the neural implementation is efficient coding. This grounds the claim that perception is a dashboard for action, not a camera for truth.

**Chapter 6 extends:** Predictive processing—perception as prediction-error minimization, attention as precision weighting, compression through temporal redundancy reduction.
