# Chapter 5: Rate–Distortion Life

> **Target**: 4,750 words | **Status**: Not Started | **Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

## Chapter Overview

**Purpose:** Introduce rate–distortion/information bottleneck as the natural language of perceptual compression.

**Core claims:** Limited channels force **task-weighted lossy codes**; asymmetric error costs produce categorical boundaries.

**Moves:** Compression: relevance filtering; Expansion: adaptive codebook growth when payoffs change.

**Measures:** Psychometric slopes, ROC/bias shifts under manipulated stakes, IB curve fits.
