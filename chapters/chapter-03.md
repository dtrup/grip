You approach a flight of stairs. Before conscious thought, before you can name what you're seeing, your visual system has already solved an embodied computation: *Can I climb this?* William Warren's 1984 experiments found that the boundary between climbable and unclimbable stairs occurs at a precise ratio—0.88 times leg length—invariant across tall and short adults. The world doesn't present "riser height: 18 inches." It presents "climbable" or "not climbable"—a relational property that exists only at the intersection of your morphology and environmental structure. Your legs don't just move you up stairs; they *measure* what counts as stairs in the first place.

This is embodiment as pre-compression. Before neural circuits categorize objects, before attention selects features, before working memory holds possibilities, your body has already discretized the continuous flux of sensory input into action-relevant categories. The compression isn't representational—it's not a mental model of stairs. It's morphological and sensorimotor: the structure of your body and the lawful coupling between your actions and sensory consequences carve possibility-space into graspable affordances.

This chapter argues three claims. First, that bodies are not neutral containers for minds but **compression devices** that turn world structure into discrete possibilities through morphology, sensor placement, and sensorimotor coupling. Second, that affordances are not objective properties "out there" nor subjective projections "in here," but **relational invariants**—possibilities for action that exist only at the intersection of agent capabilities and environmental structure. Third, that perception is not passive reception but **active exploration**—agents learn what the world affords by moving through it, and the structure of movement shapes what can be perceived.

Constraints—time, energy, information, risk, coordination—don't float free. They get channeled through flesh, bone, sensors, and effectors. This is where budgets meet the world.

## Morphology as Pre-Compression

Your body discretizes the world before your brain gets involved. Consider Warren's body-scaled affordances. A doorway 32 inches wide affords passage for most adults walking upright. But does it afford passage for someone carrying a wide object? Warren and Whang (1987) found that people accurately judge whether they can walk through an aperture when the aperture-to-shoulder-width ratio exceeds 1.3. Below that threshold, they turn sideways or judge passage impossible. The boundary is a **pi-number**—a dimensionless ratio that remains invariant across body sizes.

These ratios aren't learned correlations between sensory features and outcomes. They're structural properties of the body-world coupling. Sit-ability occurs at approximately 0.88 times leg length—the same ratio as stair climbability. Reach-ability is scaled to arm length. Graspability is scaled to hand size. The body functions as a measuring device, and the measurements are relational—they specify what the environment affords *relative to the agent's action capabilities*, not absolute physical dimensions.

This is compression in the most literal sense: continuous variation (riser height from 0 to 50 centimeters) is discretized into a binary affordance judgment (climbable/not climbable) based on a body-scaled threshold. The compression isn't lossy in a destructive way—it preserves exactly the information relevant to action. You don't need to know the riser is 18 centimeters; you need to know you can climb it. The former is a measurement. The latter is a possibility.

But there's a critical refinement. Later research by Konczak and colleagues (1992) showed that body-scaling is a special case of **action-scaling**. When comparing young adults to older adults with reduced leg strength and flexibility, the climbability threshold shifted upward for older adults—not because their legs got shorter, but because their capabilities changed. Affordances depend on *current action capabilities*, not just static morphology. A doorway affords passage differently when you're carrying groceries, wearing a backpack, or using crutches. The body isn't a fixed ruler; it's a dynamic action system.

### Morphological Computation: Bodies That Calculate

Consider Tad McGeer's 1990 passive dynamic walker. McGeer built a robot with no motors, no sensors, no control system—just the right morphology. Released on a gentle slope (3 degrees), the robot walked with a gait "quite comparable to human walking" in terms of stride length, frequency, and stability. The walker demonstrates **morphological computation**: the body's physical structure performs computation that would otherwise require neural circuits.

Walking isn't primarily a control problem solved by the brain sending detailed motor commands. It's an *interaction problem* solved by the coupling of body dynamics and environmental structure. The pendulum-like swing of the legs, the passive knee joint, the curved foot—these morphological features exploit gravity and momentum to produce stable locomotion. The intelligence is distributed across brain, body, and world. Remove the slope, and the walker stops. Remove the curved foot, and it falls. Remove the pendulum dynamics, and you need active control to stabilize each step.

This offloads computation from neural circuits to physical dynamics. Neurons are expensive—Chapter 2 detailed the tight metabolic budget. If morphology can solve part of the control problem passively, that's watts saved and milliseconds gained. The principle extends across biology. Insect legs use spring-like compliance to absorb landing impacts without neural feedback loops. Octopus arms have local sensorimotor ganglia that control reaching and grasping autonomously—the brain doesn't micromanage each sucker. Bat wings adjust camber and twist through passive aerodynamics, reducing the neural computation needed for stable flight.

But we must be precise about what "morphological computation" means. Vincent Müller and Matej Hoffmann's 2017 analysis distinguishes three senses. First, morphology can *facilitate control*—making neural computation easier without replacing it. Second, morphology can *facilitate perception*—structuring sensory input to highlight task-relevant features. Third, morphology can *perform computation proper*—implementing logical or arithmetic operations physically, as in reservoir computing where a physical substrate (e.g., water ripples, mechanical linkages) transforms inputs in ways that can be read out to solve computational problems.

Most biological cases are the first two types: facilitating rather than replacing neural computation. McGeer's walker offloads balance control but doesn't compute in the formal sense. The point is that bodies aren't passive execution devices for brain-generated commands. They're active partners in the control loop, and their structure compresses the space of possible motions into stable, efficient patterns.

### Sensor Placement and Efficient Coding

Morphology doesn't just shape action—it shapes perception. Your eyes are in the front of your head, granting binocular overlap and depth perception but leaving a blind spot directly behind. A rabbit's eyes sit on the sides, providing near-360-degree coverage but poor depth resolution. A hawk's fovea has twice the cone density of a human's, sacrificing peripheral breadth for central acuity. These aren't design flaws; they're adaptations to ecological niches. Predators need depth to pounce; prey need panoramic threat detection.

Sensor placement determines *what can be sensed* before any neural processing begins. The retina already compresses the visual signal before it reaches the optic nerve—roughly 130 million photoreceptors converge onto 1 million ganglion cells. The compression is non-uniform: the fovea (central 2 degrees of vision) projects to half the visual cortex, while peripheral vision is aggressively downsampled. This matches natural statistics: we fixate on regions of interest with saccades, so central detail matters more than peripheral detail most of the time.

Barlow's efficient coding hypothesis (1961) provides the principle: sensory systems should minimize the number of spikes needed to represent information, exploiting redundancy in natural signals. Natural images have structure—edges, textures, correlations across space and time. Retinal circuits use center-surround receptive fields to emphasize edges and differences, compressing smooth regions (low information) and amplifying discontinuities (high information). The result: ~10 million bits per second from retina to cortex, but already compressed to emphasize behaviorally relevant features.

Olshausen and Field (1996) showed that if you train a neural network to represent natural images with minimal reconstruction error *and* minimal neural activity (sparsity constraint), the learned features resemble V1 simple cell receptive fields—oriented, localized, bandpass filters. The implication: the visual system discovers the statistical structure of natural images because sparse codes are metabolically cheaper. The compression is adaptive, not arbitrary.

But sensor placement also imposes structural limits. You cannot see behind your head without turning. You cannot hear ultrasound. You cannot detect magnetic fields unless you evolve magnetoreceptors. Morphology pre-filters the world, determining which information is structurally available for compression. A bat's morphology—high-frequency vocalizations, large pinnae (outer ears), wing shape—co-evolved with echolocation. Wing morphology correlates with call structure: high aspect ratio wings (long, narrow) pair with low-frequency, long-duration calls for open-air foraging; low aspect ratio wings pair with high-frequency, short-duration calls for cluttered environments. The morphology constrains flight speed and maneuverability, which constrains optimal acoustic sampling, which constrains neural processing.

This is compression cascading through the body-brain-world system. Morphology selects sensory bandwidth. Sensors compress signals into neural codes. Neural circuits extract task-relevant features. The stack of compressions isn't serial—it's a coupled dynamical system where body, sensors, and brain co-determine what gets perceived.

## Affordances as Relational Invariants

James Gibson's *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception* (1979) introduced the concept of affordances: "what the environment offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill." A surface affords support if it's horizontal, flat, extended, and rigid relative to the animal's size and weight. Water affords drinking if you're thirsty and it's uncontaminated. A predator affords danger. An escape route affords safety. Affordances are possibilities for action.

But Gibson insisted on a deeper point: affordances are neither objective properties nor subjective projections. They're **relational invariants**—facts about the fit between agent and environment. A chair affords sitting for a human but not for a mouse. A branch affords perching for a bird but not for a fish. The property "sit-able" doesn't exist in the chair alone, nor in the perceiver alone, but in the relation. Gibson wrote that affordances are "equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior."

This cuts across the subjective-objective dichotomy. Philosophers have long debated whether perception is direct (realists) or mediated by representations (representationalists). Gibson argued for **direct perception**: affordances are perceived without intermediate inference. You don't first register "horizontal surface, flat, rigid, knee-height" and then infer "I can sit there." You *see* the sit-ability directly. The visual system picks up relational invariants—structural properties that remain stable across variations in lighting, viewing angle, and distance—and these invariants specify affordances.

Warren's body-scaled ratios are examples of such invariants. The ratio of riser height to leg length is a dimensionless number—a pure relation. It doesn't depend on the units of measurement or the absolute size of the agent. Tall people and short people use the same ratio to judge climbability. The invariant is *intrinsic* to the body-environment coupling. Perception doesn't compute the ratio explicitly—it resonates to it, tuning action to the relational structure.

But does this mean perception is truly "representation-free"? The debate continues. Computational vision (following David Marr's 1982 framework) argues that perception builds internal models—3D scene geometry, object categories, depth maps—and uses them to guide action. Gibson's ecological approach counters that these representations are unnecessary: the world itself is its own best model, and agents extract invariants through exploratory action.

The tension eases if we adopt a functional stance. Whether you call it "direct perception" or "representation mediated by action," the key insight is that perception is tuned to *control-relevant structure*, not exhaustive truth. The visual system doesn't model every photon; it extracts affordances—sit-able, climbable, graspable, avoidable. The compression preserves action-relevant invariants and discards the rest. Gibson's contribution isn't metaphysical purity; it's the recognition that perception serves action, and affordances are the natural currency of that service.

### Optic Flow and Ecological Information

David Lee's tau hypothesis (1976) proposed that time-to-contact information is directly available in the rate of optical expansion. As you approach a surface, the visual angle θ subtended by an object grows. The ratio τ = θ / (dθ/dt) specifies time-to-contact without requiring knowledge of object size or approach velocity. Lee argued that animals use tau to control braking, landing, catching, and collision avoidance.

The tau hypothesis was elegant and influential, spawned decades of research, and turned out to be false in its strong form. James Tresilian's 1999 review, "Visually timed action: Time-out for 'tau'?", showed that multiple optical variables influence time-to-contact perception in task-dependent ways. Tau alone doesn't suffice. Observers also use target size, velocity, binocular disparity, and motion parallax. The strategy depends on the task: catching a ball versus braking a car versus timing a jump.

But Lee's broader contribution endures: **ecological information** exists in high-order patterns—relations among relations—that specify action-relevant structure without requiring detailed world models. Consider the **locomotor flow line**, the horizon line formed by zero optical flow during forward locomotion. It specifies heading direction directly: look where the flow converges. The **horizon ratio** (the ratio of gaze angle to surface angle) remains invariant for horizontal surfaces, allowing walkers to detect slopes without computing 3D geometry.

These are **higher-order invariants**—relational structures that are stable across transformations. Gibson called them "invariants over transformation." When you move your head, nearby objects shift more than distant ones (motion parallax), but the ratio of shifts specifies relative depth. When you walk, the optic flow field has a pole of expansion in your direction of travel—wherever the flow converges, that's where you're headed. These patterns don't require object recognition or scene segmentation. They emerge from the geometry of self-motion and can be picked up by relatively simple neural detectors.

The visual system exploits these patterns. Neurons in medial superior temporal area (MST) respond to optic flow patterns—expansion, contraction, rotation. They're not computing a 3D world model; they're detecting flow structures that specify heading, depth, and surface layout. Perception is tuned to the task.

### Attunement and Calibration

Brett Fajen's work on **affordance-based control** extends Warren's body-scaling into a developmental and learning framework. Fajen distinguishes two processes: **attunement** (perceptual learning to detect affordances) and **calibration** (action tuning to current capabilities).

Attunement is the process by which agents learn which perceptual variables specify which affordances. Infants don't initially know that a certain visual texture specifies a graspable edge or that a certain slant specifies a climbable slope. They learn through active exploration—reaching, crawling, stumbling—and discovering which optical patterns predict successful actions. Eleanor Gibson and Richard Walk's famous "visual cliff" experiments (1960) showed that crawling infants avoid apparent drop-offs even on their first encounter, suggesting either innate depth perception or very rapid learning. Follow-up studies suggest it's rapid learning: pre-crawling infants (who are carried by parents) show less cliff avoidance, while experienced crawlers show strong avoidance.

Calibration is the ongoing process of adjusting affordance perception to current capabilities. Fajen's studies of braking show that people accurately judge whether they can stop before a barrier, and they adjust this judgment when wearing a heavy backpack or fatigued from exercise. The affordance isn't fixed by static body dimensions—it tracks *action-scaled* capabilities. Wheelchair users develop skills to detect passage affordances for doorways, ramps, and curbs—learning to judge what's navigable given their current tool-body system. Tool use extends this principle: after using a rake to reach distant objects, your peripersonal space—the region around your body where visual and tactile information integrates—expands to include the tool tip. The body schema incorporates the tool.

This dynamic view aligns with the broader framework: affordances are control-relevant compressions, and control depends on current budgets (energy, time, skill). As budgets shift—fatigue, injury, tool use, learning—affordances shift with them. The compression is adaptive, not static.

## Sensorimotor Contingencies and Active Perception

Paul Bach-y-Rita's 1969 tactile vision substitution system (TVSS) placed a camera on a blind subject's head and converted the video signal to tactile vibrations on a 20x20 array on their back. After hours of training, subjects reported perceiving objects *in external space*, not on their backs. A coffee cup wasn't a pattern of buzzes; it was a cup "out there." They could point to it, judge its distance, track its motion.

The system demonstrates a startling claim: the brain doesn't care about sensory modality—photons versus vibrations—it cares about **sensorimotor contingencies**, the lawful relations between actions and sensory changes. When you move your head left, the tactile pattern shifts right, just as a visual image would. When you reach toward the cup, the pattern expands, just as visual looming would occur. The brain learns these contingencies and constructs spatial perception from them. Embodiment isn't about *which* sensors you have; it's about *how* they couple to action.

Later work confirmed this principle. Congenitally blind individuals trained with visual-to-auditory sensory substitution (the vOICe system, which converts images to soundscapes) show activation in visual cortex during object recognition tasks. The "visual" cortex isn't intrinsically visual—it's a processor of spatial sensorimotor contingencies, and it doesn't care if the input comes from retina or microphone. Cross-modal plasticity is profound: early blind individuals recruit visual cortex for tactile and auditory processing, and the recruitment is functionally meaningful—disrupting visual cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impairs Braille reading.

This shifts the explanatory weight from sensory modality to **action-sensation coupling**. Alva Noë and Kevin O'Regan (2001) formalized this as the sensorimotor contingency theory: perceptual experience is constituted by the agent's mastery of sensorimotor contingencies. To see is to know how visual input changes with movement—turn your head and the scene shifts; close your eyes and it disappears; move toward an object and it looms. To touch is to know how tactile input changes with hand motion—press harder and texture becomes more salient; move laterally and edges are detected. Perception is an active, skillful engagement with the world's lawful structure.

### Motor Babbling and Embodied Learning

Infants don't arrive with a pre-wired body schema. They build it through **motor babbling**—random motor commands followed by observation of sensory consequences. By moving limbs and watching them move, infants learn the mapping between motor commands and sensory feedback. This is how they learn to reach for objects.

Reaching emerges around 4 months. Initially, it's inefficient—multiple speed changes, circuitous paths, frequent misses. Infants don't require vision of their own hand to reach successfully, suggesting that visual-motor coordination develops without continuous visual feedback. Neil Berthier and Rachel Keen (2006) documented the developmental trajectory: by 3-4 months, infants engage in spontaneous self-touching (hand-to-hand, hand-to-body), which allows coordination of proprioceptive and tactile signals. By 5-6 months, ipsilateral reaching to stationary objects is reliable. By 8 months, they reach to moving objects and show strong hand preferences. By 10 months, bimanual coordination and tool use emerge.

Motor babbling is exploration at the sensorimotor level. It's the infant's way of discovering the body's affordances—what movements produce what sensory outcomes. Without this exploration, the mapping remains unlearned. Studies of deafferented patients (individuals who lose proprioception due to peripheral nerve damage) show that they can still perform many actions with visual feedback, but movements are slow, effortful, and require continuous attention. The body schema is fragile without sensory confirmation.

The principle extends to robotics. Rolf, Steil, and Gienger (2010) developed **goal babbling** for robot inverse kinematics learning: instead of exploring motor commands randomly (motor babbling), explore goal positions randomly and use whatever motor commands get you there (goal babbling). Goal babbling is more efficient because it focuses exploration on behaviorally relevant outcomes. The robot learns to reach by exploring reachable space, not by trying every possible joint configuration.

This is expansion through exploration. The agent doesn't compress prematurely—it explores broadly, discovers the structure of its body-world coupling, and then compresses that structure into efficient sensorimotor mappings. Compression without prior exploration yields brittle, impoverished affordances. Expansion followed by compression yields robust, adaptive control.

### Two Visual Pathways: Perception and Action

Melvyn Goodale and David Milner's (1992) work on the dorsal and ventral visual streams revealed a profound dissociation. The ventral stream (V1 → temporal lobe) is the "what" pathway: object recognition, conscious perception, memory. The dorsal stream (V1 → parietal lobe) is the "how" pathway: visuomotor control, action guidance, real-time grasping.

Patient D.F., who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning that damaged ventral stream areas, could not consciously identify objects or their orientation. Show her a slot and ask her to describe its angle—she guessed randomly. But ask her to post a card through the slot, and she rotated the card smoothly to match the slot's orientation. Her dorsal stream could guide action despite absent conscious perception. She could grasp objects accurately—scaling grip aperture to object size—even though she couldn't report their size or shape.

This demonstrates **action-oriented embodiment** bypassing conscious representation. The dorsal stream compresses visual input into action parameters—hand orientation, grip aperture, trajectory—without generating conscious percepts. It operates in real time (updating within 100-200 milliseconds as objects move) and uses egocentric coordinates (body-centered, not world-centered). The ventral stream operates more slowly, builds allocentric (world-centered) representations, and supports recognition and memory.

The dissociation reveals two modes of compression, optimized for different tasks. The dorsal stream compresses for fast, accurate action—preserving spatial relations, motion, and affordances. The ventral stream compresses for recognition, categorization, and memory—preserving identity invariances across viewing conditions. Both are lossy, but they preserve different structure.

### Peripersonal Space: The Body's Action Boundary

Peripersonal space is the region immediately surrounding the body where visual and tactile information integrate. Neurons in the ventral intraparietal cortex (VIP) respond to touch on the hand *and* to visual stimuli near the hand—typically within 5-30 centimeters. These bimodal neurons have visual receptive fields that are anchored to body parts and move with them. If you move your hand, the visual receptive field moves with it.

Tool use extends peripersonal space. Angelo Maravita and Atsushi Iriki (2004) trained monkeys to use a rake to retrieve distant food. After training, the visual receptive fields of bimodal neurons expanded to include the rake's length—the neurons responded to visual stimuli near the rake tip as if the rake were part of the body. The body schema is plastic, incorporating tools as functional extensions.

Peripersonal space isn't just spatial—it's functional. It defines the region where you can act: reach, grasp, defend. Objects within peripersonal space afford immediate interaction. Objects beyond it require locomotion. The boundary is fuzzy and context-dependent: under threat, defensive peripersonal space expands; when using long tools, action space expands. The compression is dynamic, adjusting to current capabilities and goals.

This aligns with Gibson's affordances: peripersonal space is the spatial manifestation of action possibilities. The visual-tactile integration isn't about building a 3D world model—it's about tagging regions where action is possible, right now, with this body-tool configuration.

## Development and Plasticity

Embodiment isn't innate—it develops through active exploration during sensitive periods. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's Nobel Prize-winning work (1970) on kittens showed that monocular deprivation during a critical period (3-5 weeks postnatally) leads to permanent reorganization: 98% of V1 neurons become unresponsive to the deprived eye. Normal visual development requires timely binocular experience. Without it, neural circuits fail to wire properly, and the deprivation is irreversible after the critical period closes.

The principle extends to embodiment. Infant reaching, crawling, and locomotion aren't preprogrammed—they emerge through exploration and consolidate through practice. Denied opportunities to explore (e.g., prolonged swaddling, movement restriction), motor development is delayed. Romanian orphans raised in cribs with minimal stimulation show profound motor and cognitive delays—not because they lack genes for walking, but because they lack the embodied exploration that tunes sensorimotor couplings.

### Body Schema vs. Body Image

Shaun Gallagher (1986) distinguished **body schema** (preconscious sensorimotor representations guiding action) from **body image** (conscious perceptions and beliefs about one's body). The body schema is fast, automatic, proprioceptive, action-oriented. It's what lets you reach for a coffee cup without consciously calculating joint angles. The body image is slower, conceptual, sometimes distorted (as in anorexia or phantom limb). The two can dissociate.

Gallagher and Jonathan Cole (1995) studied a deafferented patient with no proprioception below the neck. The patient could walk, dress, and eat with visual feedback, but if the lights went out, movement stopped. The body schema functions for action even when body image is impaired. Conversely, phantom limb patients consciously perceive a limb that isn't there—the body image persists despite absent body and schema.

The body schema is the compression that matters for control. It's the real-time, adaptive mapping between motor commands and expected sensory consequences. It's learned through motor babbling and updated through tool use, injury, and growth. The body image is the conceptual layer—useful for long-term planning and social interaction, but not critical for immediate action. Merleau-Ponty called the body schema "motor intentionality"—a pre-reflective understanding of how to navigate the world. It's grip in its most embodied form.

### Social Learning and Coordination Protocols

Honeybees use the waggle dance to communicate food source locations. The waggle phase duration encodes distance; the angle encodes direction relative to the sun's azimuth. But James Nieh and colleagues (2008, 2023) found that bees who mature without observing experienced dancers make systematic errors—they signal longer distances, more erratic angles, and take longer to complete dances. **Untutored bees never recover accurate distance coding**, even with foraging experience.

This demonstrates that embodied coordination protocols require social scaffolding, not just individual exploration. The waggle dance isn't pure instinct—it's a culturally transmitted skill. The precision of the dance trades off against foraging time (communication overhead). Too precise, and the colony spends excessive time dancing instead of foraging. Too imprecise, and foragers waste energy flying to wrong locations. The evolutionarily stable strategy balances communication cost and foraging efficiency, and that balance must be learned socially.

The bee example illustrates a general principle: embodied skills, even those with strong genetic scaffolding, require timely social input. Human infants learn to walk by observing walkers, hearing encouragement, receiving postural support. Blind infants walk later than sighted infants, not because vision is mechanically necessary for walking, but because visual observation of others' walking provides a scaffold for learning the gait pattern. Embodiment is social.

## Compression ↔ Expansion Dynamics

Embodiment exhibits the dual dynamics we've emphasized throughout.

**Compression:** Bodies discretize continuous sensory flux into affordances. Morphology pre-filters possibilities (sensor placement, effector constraints). Sensorimotor contingencies compress action-sensation mappings into efficient schemas. Categorical perception compresses continuous speech sounds into discrete phonemes, continuous color spectra into named categories. The body schema compresses proprioceptive and visual feedback into immediate action guidance.

**Expansion:** Active exploration—motor babbling, saccadic sampling, haptic manipulation—widens the space of discovered affordances. Tool use extends peripersonal space and action capabilities. Social learning transmits coordination protocols that individuals couldn't discover alone. Redundancy and degeneracy—multiple sensory cues for the same affordance, multiple motor pathways to the same action—increase robustness. The body doesn't just compress; it explores, adapts, extends.

### Failure Modes

**Developmental deprivation.** If critical periods pass without appropriate sensorimotor experience, embodied compressions fail to form. Hubel and Wiesel's monocularly deprived kittens never regain binocular vision. Infants denied opportunities to reach and grasp show lasting motor deficits. The window closes. The lesson: embodiment requires timely, active engagement.

**Sensory mismatch.** Virtual reality (VR) can induce motion sickness when visual and vestibular signals conflict. Your eyes signal forward motion; your inner ear signals stationary. The sensorimotor contingencies violate learned expectations, and the mismatch triggers nausea. The body schema depends on consistent couplings. Break them, and disorientation follows.

**Affordance misjudgment.** Older adults with reduced leg strength sometimes misjudge stair climbability, leading to falls. The body-scaled affordance boundary has shifted, but perception hasn't fully recalibrated. Similarly, tool users sometimes overestimate extended reach (e.g., misjudging whether a rake can reach an object), especially when fatigued. Calibration lags capability changes.

**Over-reliance on single modalities.** Blind individuals compensate by recruiting visual cortex for auditory and tactile processing, but the compensation isn't always complete—spatial navigation remains more effortful without vision. Deafferented patients can perform actions with visual feedback but at high cognitive cost. Robustness comes from multimodal redundancy; single-channel reliance is brittle.

---

## Measures and Tests

**Body-scaled affordance boundaries.** Measure climbability judgments as a function of leg length, aperture passage as a function of shoulder width, reach-ability as a function of arm length. Plot pi-numbers (dimensionless ratios) and test for invariance across individuals. Prediction: boundaries should cluster around specific ratios (e.g., 0.88 for stairs).

**Morphological computation via perturbation.** Alter body dynamics (add weights to limbs, change foot shape, apply resistance) and measure impact on locomotion stability. Prediction: morphological features that passively stabilize gait (curved feet, pendulum dynamics) should reduce neural control cost, measurable via EMG activity or cortical load.

**Sensory substitution learning curves.** Train participants with tactile-visual or auditory-visual substitution devices. Measure object localization accuracy, distance judgment, navigation efficiency over days/weeks. Prediction: performance improves as sensorimotor contingencies are learned, and spatial perception shifts from skin/ear to external space.

**Tool-use extension of peripersonal space.** Use crossmodal congruency task (visual distractor near hand affects tactile discrimination) before and after tool training. Measure spatial extent of visual-tactile interaction. Prediction: after tool use, the interaction zone expands to tool length.

**Affordance recalibration with capability changes.** Test stair climbability judgments before and after wearing a heavy backpack, or before and after leg fatigue from exercise. Prediction: affordance boundaries shift to reflect current capabilities (action-scaling), not just static morphology (body-scaling).

**Motor babbling and schema development.** Track infant reaching trajectories (path straightness, velocity profiles, success rate) over weeks. Correlate development with spontaneous self-touching frequency (motor babbling). Prediction: infants with more self-touching show faster reaching improvement.

**Social learning of embodied coordination.** In controlled settings, train novices on a coordination task (e.g., rowing, dancing) with or without observing skilled performers. Measure learning rate and final precision. Prediction: observation accelerates learning and improves final performance, especially for tasks with non-obvious coordination patterns.

Every claim is testable. Every affordance has a measurable boundary. Every compression can be perturbed. That's the standard.

## Forward: From Affordances to Metaphysics

We've argued that bodies pre-compress the world, that affordances are relational invariants exposed by action, and that perception is active exploration of sensorimotor contingencies. Embodiment channels abstract constraints—time, energy, information—into concrete possibilities. The body is not a neutral vessel; it's a structure that determines what can be perceived and what can be done.

But we've skirted a philosophical tension. Are affordances "real" in an objective sense, or are they pragmatic fictions useful for control? Gibson claimed they're real relations—facts about the world-agent coupling. Critics argue they're agent-relative projections with no independent existence. Defenders of representation argue that perception must build internal models; critics counter that the world is its own best model. The debate risks metaphysical gridlock.

Chapter 4 takes a different approach. Instead of adjudicating between realism, structural realism, process views, and pragmatism, we treat them as **compatible lenses on the same control problem**. Affordances can be described as real relations (realism), as structural invariants (structural realism), as relational processes (process metaphysics), or as instrumentally useful compressions (pragmatism)—and the functional necessities remain the same. Different ontologies, same grip.

The constraints come first. Embodiment channels them. Metaphysics is what we argue about afterward. But the control problem—how to act effectively under budgets—is neutral to those arguments. That's the stance we develop next.

The body has done its job: turning budgets into handles. Now we see what metaphysics makes of it.

## Chapter Summary (for continuity tracking)

**Core Argument**: Embodiment pre-compresses the world through morphology, sensor placement, and sensorimotor coupling. Bodies aren't neutral containers for minds; they discretize continuous flux into action-relevant categories. Affordances are relational invariants—possibilities for action that exist only at the intersection of agent capabilities and environmental structure. Perception is active exploration; affordances are discovered through movement, not passively perceived.

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- **Affordance**: Action possibility relative to agent and context; a relational invariant, not objective property or subjective projection.
- **Morphological computation**: Body structure performs computation that would otherwise require neural circuits; physical dynamics offload from neurons.
- **Body-scaled ratios**: Pi-numbers (dimensionless proportions) define action boundaries; same ratio (e.g., 0.88 for climbability) invariant across body sizes.
- **Sensorimotor contingencies**: Lawful relations between actions and sensory changes; perception constituted by mastery of these couplings.
- **Motor babbling**: Random motor exploration that discovers body-world mappings; enables learning of sensorimotor schemas.
- **Tool incorporation**: Body schema plastically extends to include tools; peripersonal space expands with rake training in monkeys.

**Major Examples Used**:
- Warren's stairs: visual system solves "Can I climb?" through body-scaled ratio, not through explicit physics.
- Passive dynamic walker: morphology achieves stable gait without motors or control, offloading computation to physics.
- Bach-y-Rita's tactile vision substitution: spatial structure transfers across modalities; the blind learn to "see" through touch because sensorimotor contingencies are preserved.
- Goodale & Milner's patient D.F.: dissociation between dorsal (action) and ventral (conscious perception) streams; accurate grasping despite absent object recognition.
- Developmental trajectory: infants learn affordances through active exploration (reaching, crawling); critical periods shape embodied skills.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Chapter 4 addresses the philosophical question embodiment raises: Are affordances "real," or are they agent-relative constructs? Different metaphysical frames (realism, structural realism, process philosophy, pragmatism) offer different answers. Yet they converge on the same functional necessities for control.
