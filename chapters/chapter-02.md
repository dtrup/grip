# Chapter 2: Constraints Before Categories

> **Target**: 4,750 words | **Status**: Not Started | **Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

## Chapter Overview

**Purpose:** Argue that **time, energy, information, risk, and coordination** are the live descendants of "transcendental conditions."

**Core claims:** These budgets structure what can be sensed, computed, and coordinated; they are measurable and tunable.

**Failure modes:** Treating budgets as fixed essences; ignoring interaction effects (e.g., time–risk trade-offs).

**Measures:** Latency–accuracy curves, metabolic load, channel capacity estimates, coordination cost indices.
