# Chapter 1: The Problem of Grip

> **Target**: 4,750 words | **Status**: Not Started | **Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

## Chapter Overview

**Purpose:** Motivate a unifying question: how do agents make an unruly world tractable enough to live in?

**Core claims:**
- (a) Grip requires selection and simplification
- (b) Constraints are not obstacles but **enablers** of usable form
- (c) Success is measured in **control** and **anticipation**, not mirror-truth

**Compression/Expansion:** Introduce compression as selective fidelity; foreshadow expansion via curiosity and scaffolding.

**Measures:** Framing tasks, bounded rationality benchmarks.
