# Chapter 4: Neutral Stances, Convergent Functions

> **Target**: 4,750 words | **Status**: Not Started | **Last Updated**: 2025-10-10

## Chapter Overview

**Purpose:** Situate realism, structural realism, process metaphysics, and pragmatism as compatible readings of one control problem.

**Core claims:** Different ontologies, same functional necessities: **good regulation** demands internal models tuned to control, not to essence.

**Measures:** Cross-agent convergence on invariants; transfer across modalities and media.
