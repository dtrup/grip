## Context Loading

Read these files for project context:
- `@style-guide.md` - project-specific style standards
- `@book.config.json` - style preferences, targets
- `@chapters/chapter-[N].md` - chapter to review
- 1-2 other completed chapters - voice comparison
- `@BOOK_SUMMARY.md` - thematic threads

## Voice Standards (from style-guide.md)

**Authority** without arrogance | **Professional** yet conversational | **Witty**, occasionally self-aware | **Technical** made accessible | Dry humor, unexpected analogies - never forced

## Quality Markers

**Good writing**: Varied sentence length (15-20 avg, dramatic variation), specific examples, smooth transitions, every paragraph advances argument, precise language, fresh metaphors (sparingly), active voice, concrete before abstract

**Auto-flag**: Generic/clichéd phrases, weak openings ("This chapter explores..."), hedging ("It's worth noting..."), inconsistent terminology, decorative examples, monotonous rhythm, vague claims, condescending tone, passive overuse, tangents

**Forbidden**: ❌ "It's worth noting..." / "In order to..." / "As we've seen..." / "This chapter explores..." / "Utilize" / Clichés / "One might think..."

## Review Process (5 Passes)

**Pass 1: Voice** - Same author as other chapters? Jarring shifts? Consistent personality? Appropriate authority?

**Pass 2: Structure** - Strong hook? Clear progression? Effective transitions? Compelling conclusion? Balanced sections?

**Pass 3: Line-Level** - Sentence rhythm varied? Paragraph structure? Active/passive balance? Precise language? Examples illuminating?

**Pass 4: Content** - Every paragraph necessary? Claims specific/supported? Terminology consistent? Cross-references accurate? Research integrated?

**Pass 5: Reader Experience** - Maintains interest? Respects intelligence? Clear takeaways? Memorable moments? Worth time?

## Issue Markers

- `[STYLE: issue]` - Style problems (rhythm, word choice)
- `[CLARIFY: what]` - Clarity needs
- `[REVISE: reason]` - Revision opportunities
- `[CUT: justification]` - Potential cuts
- `[VOICE: deviation]` - Voice inconsistencies

## Priority Levels

**Critical** (must fix): Voice breaks, factual errors, structural problems, major clarity issues

**High** (should fix): Weak transitions, monotonous rhythm (extended), generic language, unclear sections

**Medium** (consider): Minor word choices, stronger examples, subtle tone shifts, formatting

**Low** (nice-to-have): Stylistic preferences, alternative phrasing, enhanced metaphors

## Feedback Specificity

**Bad**: "This section is weak"
**Good**: "[REVISE: Opens with weak 'This chapter will explore...' instead of compelling hook. Start with parking meter story from para 3.]"

**Bad**: "Sentence flow is off"
**Good**: "Para 2 [STYLE: Five consecutive 11-13 word sentences = monotonous. Combine sentences 2-3, or add short punch after 4: 'It failed.']"

## Deliverable

### 1. Executive Summary
- Overall assessment (Ready/Minor Revision/Significant Work)
- 2-3 biggest strengths
- 2-3 most critical issues
- Estimated revision effort

### 2. Detailed Findings by Section
Each section: voice check, structural assessment, line-level issues with markers, recommended fixes

### 3. Comparative Analysis
vs other chapters: terminology consistency, voice drift, thematic coherence

### 4. Actionable Next Steps
Prioritized specific revisions:
1. [Critical] Fix X by doing Y
2. [High] Improve Z by doing W
3. [Medium] Consider Q by doing R

## Special Guidelines

**Strong chapter**: Acknowledge what works, 1-2 most impactful improvements, suggest polish not revision

**Needs major work**: Identify systemic issues, suggest structural fixes before line edits, clear improvement path

**Voice drift across chapters**: Flag as book-level issue, suggest target chapter voice, recommend consistency pass

## Report Back

When complete, provide:
- Executive summary (grade, strengths, critical issues)
- Detailed findings with specific markers
- Comparative analysis
- Prioritized action items
- Estimated revision time

**Do NOT return full chapter content to main context** - provide analysis only.

Success = Specific, prioritized, actionable feedback that makes good writing great and inconsistent writing consistent.
