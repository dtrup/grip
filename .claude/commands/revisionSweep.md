# Revision Sweep: Systematic Content Improvement

Perform a focused revision pass across all written chapters to elevate quality.

## Your Task

1. **Assess revision scope**:
   - @BOOK_SUMMARY.md - identify chapters ready for revision
   - Scan all chapters/ for [REVISE], [CUT], [EXPAND], [CLARIFY] markers
   - @style-guide.md - remind yourself of quality standards
   - @book.config.json - check targets and style preferences

2. **Choose revision focus** (pick one):
   - **Style polish**: Enhance voice, flow, and readability
   - **Content strengthening**: Improve arguments and examples
   - **Structure optimization**: Better organization and transitions
   - **Length adjustment**: Trim excess or expand thin sections

3. **Execute systematic improvements**:
   - Work through chapters in order to maintain consistency
   - Address marked revision notes first
   - Apply consistent improvements across similar passages
   - Maintain voice and tone throughout

4. **Specific revision targets**:
   - **Sharpen openings**: Make first paragraphs more compelling
   - **Strengthen examples**: Ensure they illustrate points clearly
   - **Smooth transitions**: Improve flow between sections and chapters
   - **Clarify complex ideas**: Make difficult concepts more accessible
   - **Eliminate redundancy**: Remove repetitive content
   - **Enhance conclusions**: Make chapter endings more impactful

5. **Track improvements**:
   - Note what types of changes you made
   - Update word counts if significantly changed
   - Remove resolved [REVISE] markers
   - Add new ones if you identify additional issues

6. **Update project status**:
   - Mark revised chapters as "üîç Revised" in BOOK_SUMMARY.md
   - Add revision completion date
   - Note key improvements made

Focus on elevating the entire book's quality systematically.
