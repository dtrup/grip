# Thematic Analysis: Delegate to Cross-Chapter Theme Expert

This command delegates thematic analysis to the **thematic-analyst** subagent, a specialist in cross-chapter coherence and narrative threads.

## What Happens

The thematic-analyst subagent will:

1. **Read all book content**:
   - TOC, BOOK_SUMMARY, all chapters, brainstorms, style guide
   - Use Glob to find all chapter files
   - Use Grep to track recurring terms and concepts

2. **Identify and map thematic threads** (3-7 major themes):
   - Define each theme's role in the book
   - Track appearance across chapters
   - Map development arc (introduction ‚Üí development ‚Üí climax ‚Üí resolution)
   - Identify gaps, inconsistencies, opportunities

3. **Check concept consistency**:
   - Track key terms from first introduction
   - Verify consistent usage across chapters
   - Flag terminology drift or contradictions
   - Recommend standardization

4. **Map cross-chapter connections**:
   - Document callbacks to earlier chapters
   - Identify forward setups and payoffs
   - Find orphaned concepts (mentioned once, never developed)
   - Suggest missing opportunities for connections

5. **Assess narrative arc**:
   - Analyze book-level argument progression
   - Evaluate pacing (fast/slow/balanced sections)
   - Provide structural recommendations

6. **Deliver comprehensive analysis**:
   - **Executive Summary**: Overall coherence assessment, major strengths, critical issues
   - **Thematic Thread Analysis**: Chapter-by-chapter mapping for each theme
   - **Concept Consistency Report**: Term tracking and inconsistencies
   - **Cross-Chapter Connection Map**: Callbacks, setups, payoffs, missing opportunities
   - **Prioritized Action Items**: Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low priority fixes
