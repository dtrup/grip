# Find Content Gaps and Weak Areas

Systematically identify what's missing, weak, or incomplete in your book.

## Your Task

1. **Read project scope**:
   - @TOC.md - planned coverage and structure
   - @book.config.json - targets and goals
   - @BOOK_SUMMARY.md - current status
   - All chapters with content

2. **Content gap analysis**:
   - **Missing chapters**: Which chapters from TOC aren't written yet?
   - **Thin chapters**: Which completed chapters are significantly under target length?
   - **Missing examples**: Where are concrete illustrations needed?
   - **Weak arguments**: Which claims need better support or evidence?
   - **Incomplete research**: Scan for [RESEARCH] and [TODO] markers

3. **Structural gap analysis**:
   - **Logical holes**: Are there missing steps in arguments?
   - **Transition problems**: Where do chapters connect poorly?
   - **Missing context**: What background knowledge does the reader need?
   - **Unresolved questions**: What issues are raised but not addressed?

4. **Reader experience gaps**:
   - **Engagement drops**: Where might readers lose interest?
   - **Complexity jumps**: Any sudden difficulty increases?
   - **Missing payoffs**: Are all promises made to readers fulfilled?
   - **Unclear takeaways**: Where are main points not sufficiently emphasized?

5. **Prioritized recommendations**:
   - **Critical gaps**: Must-fix issues that undermine the book
   - **Quality improvements**: Nice-to-have enhancements  
   - **Strategic additions**: Content that would significantly strengthen arguments
   - **Structural fixes**: Organizational improvements

6. **Create action plan**:
   - Rank gaps by importance and effort required
   - Suggest specific next steps for addressing top issues
   - Update BOOK_SUMMARY.md with gap analysis results

Transform gap identification into a clear improvement roadmap.
