# Grip: A Transcendental Aesthetics of the Psyche

**By dtp**

> From World Constraints to Fitness Interfaces to Cultural Intelligence

## About This Book

**Genre**: Academic Non-Fiction (Cognitive Science, Philosophy, Information Theory) | **Status**: In Progress | **Target**: 100,000+ words

### What This Book Does

Agents gain **grip** on a complex world by building, revising, and sharing **compressions under constraints**, and by **expanding** capacity through exploration, redundancy, and social scaffolding. This book develops a unified frameworkâ€”metaphysically neutral, formally grounded, empirically testableâ€”that bridges neurons, persons, and institutions through one control-theoretic spine.
