## Project Overview
- **Title**: Grip: A Transcendental Aesthetics of the Psyche
- **Subtitle**: From World Constraints to Fitness Interfaces to Cultural Intelligence
- **Author**: dtp
- **Genre**: Academic Non-Fiction (Cognitive Science, Philosophy, Information Theory)
- **Target Length**: 100,000+ words

- **Total Chapters**: 21 (20 chapters + Coda)
- **Started**: 2025-10-10
- **Estimated Completion**: TBD

## Book Ambition

### Core Thesis
Agents gain **grip** on a complex world by building, revising, and sharing **compressions under constraints**, and by **expanding** capacity through exploration, redundancy, and social scaffolding. This yields a continuum from **world constraints → embodiment/affordances → payoff-biased perception → schemas/frames → symbols/narratives → institutions/technologies**.

### Reader Transformation
Readers will gain a unified framework for understanding how minds (biological and cultural) make complexity actionable—a "wise operating system" for thought that is metaphysically neutral, formally grounded, empirically testable, and practically useful for research, design, therapy, education, policy, and AI.

### Unique Value
**Unification without dogma:** Treats metaphysical positions as compatible lenses. **Compression + Expansion:** Adds exploration, degeneracy, and scaffolding as systematic capacity-builders. **From Payoff to Ought:** Generalizes distortion to value-weighted trade-offs. **Scale-bridging:** One formal spine links neurons, persons, and polities. **Actionable science:** Each chapter closes with measures & tests.
