## Voice & Tone

### Core Voice
- **Authority Level**: [Expert/Knowledgeable/Learning] - How authoritative should you sound?
- **Formality**: [Academic/Professional/Conversational/Casual] - How formal is the language?
- **Personality**: [Serious/Witty/Warm/Direct] - What personality comes through?

### Tone Characteristics  
- **Engagement Style**: [Narrative/Analytical/Instructional] - How do you engage readers?
- **Humor**: [None/Dry/Warm/Playful] - What kind of humor, if any?
- **Technical Approach**: [Accessible/Moderate/Advanced] - How technical to get?

## Writing Principles

### Core Rules
1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Make complex ideas accessible
2. **Show, then tell** - Use examples before abstract principles  
3. **Vary your rhythm** - Mix short punchy sentences with flowing passages
4. **Honor the reader** - Never waste their time or talk down to them

### Specific Guidelines
- **Sentence length**: Aim for average 15-20 words, but vary dramatically
- **Paragraph length**: 3-6 sentences typically, but break for emphasis
- **Examples**: Use specific, concrete cases rather than generic hypotheticals
- **Transitions**: Link ideas explicitly - don't make readers guess connections
- **Metaphors**: Use sparingly and make them memorable when you do

### Avoid These Patterns
- ❌ "It's worth noting that..." (just note it)
- ❌ "In order to understand X, we must..." (just explain X)
- ❌ "As we've seen..." (readers remember, don't remind them)
- ❌ Overuse of "utilize" (use "use")
- ❌ Weak openings like "This chapter explores..."

## Chapter Structure Standards

### Opening Hook (Every Chapter)
- Start with: story, question, paradox, or striking fact
- Connect to chapter's core message within 200 words
- Make readers want to continue

### Section Flow
- **Build momentum**: Each section should feel essential
- **Maintain focus**: Don't chase interesting tangents  
- **Land insights**: End sections with clear takeaways, not summaries

### Chapter Conclusions
- **Synthesis**: Pull threads together, don't just recap
- **Bridge**: Set up the next chapter naturally
- **Resonance**: Leave readers with something memorable

## Quality Standards

### Every Chapter Must
- [ ] Advance the book's overall argument
- [ ] Provide specific, actionable insights
- [ ] Include compelling examples or stories
- [ ] Flow smoothly from the previous chapter
- [ ] Set up future content appropriately

### Review Questions
- Does this chapter change how readers think about the topic?
- Would removing this chapter hurt the book's argument?
- Are examples illuminating or just decorative?
- Is the voice consistent with other chapters?
- Does it honor the reader's time and intelligence?
